This repository is for pilot's travel across the US borders and deal with US Customs and Border Patrol (US CBP), Mexico, Canada, and Bahamas

Many pilot's use ForeFlight as their electronic flight bag (EFB) [ForeFlight](https://www.foreflight.com/) app,
which contains a feature to download and import custom *content packs* that contain  bundles of related 
content that can be accessed in the app, making it easier to adapt ForeFlight to a variety of specialized uses.

# US Custom Border (Southern Point of Entry)

This respository maintains a directory of airport restaurants viewable as waypoints on the ForeFlight map page by using the ForeFlight *content packs*.  This allows you to research and plan your destination around food.

As an example, this is how the restaurants are shown over Florida, once
the content pack is imported and selected from maps.
