# Cross Border Flying

This repository is for pilot's travel across the US borders and deal with US Customs and Border Patrol (US CBP), Mexico, Canada, and Bahamas

Many pilot's use ForeFlight as their electronic flight bag (EFB) [ForeFlight](https://www.foreflight.com/) app,
which contains a feature to download and import custom *content packs* that contain  bundles of related 
content that can be accessed in the app, making it easier to adapt ForeFlight to a variety of specialized uses.
See [ForeFlight Content Pack Overview](https://www.foreflight.com/products/foreflight-mobile/user-content/content-packs) and [ForeFlight Content Pack Support](https://foreflight.com/support/content-packs/)

 ## ForeFlight Feature Request to Automatically Update New Versions

Keeping this *content packs* updated once imported into ForeFlight requires re-downloading
newer content packs and re-importing into ForeFlight.  

#### Feature Request ####

- The ability for content packs to be downloaded and updated from a URL.
  - This would be the simplest method, a link to selected and added to downloads list and ForeFlight would periodically check for new updates. This would function the same way Downloads from ForeFlight work. Client could always delete content pack they no longer want to recieve.  

- Allow concurrent multiple cloud drive providers for Documents
  - The cloud storage feature is only available for *Performance Plus* subscribers of ForeFlight which by adding a folder named *contentpacks* to the root folder, content packs in
the folder are automatically available to download and update. However only one cloud provider is available concurrently. Pilots may need access to multiple resources, companies, flight schools, 
flight clubs, 3rd party content, etc. I envision a subscription service that provided valuable content on various contant that would currate and  keep up-to-date.

Send your support for these request to ForeFlight Support [support@foreflight.com](mailto:support@foreflight.com).
